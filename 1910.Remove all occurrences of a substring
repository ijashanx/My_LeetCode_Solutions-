# Code 

Given two strings s and part, perform the following operation on s until all occurrences of the substring part are removed:

Find the leftmost occurrence of the substring part and remove it from s.
Return s after removing all occurrences of part.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

# Solution (in java)

class Solution {
    public String removeOccurrences(String s, String part) {
        while (s.contains(part)&& s.length()!=0) { 
            s = s.replaceFirst(part, "");
        }
        return s;
    }
}
