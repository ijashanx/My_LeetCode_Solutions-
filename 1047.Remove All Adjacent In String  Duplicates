# Code Statement
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. A duplicate removal consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters and removing them.

We repeatedly make duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It can be proven that the answer is unique.

# Solution(in java)

StringBuilder stack = new StringBuilder();
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            int len = stack.length();
            if (len > 0 && stack.charAt(len - 1) == c) {
                stack.deleteCharAt(len - 1); 
            } else {
                stack.append(c); 
            }
        }
        
        return stack.toString();
